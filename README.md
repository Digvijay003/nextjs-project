# About 

+ This application created with NextAuth.js and Next.js 
+ Authentication is done with github OAuth 2.0 
+ You need to **generate credentials** first in github developer settings under section named OAuth App
+ I also added authentication with email credentials using MongoDB and NextAuth.js although it is **commented** right now 
+ If you wish to create repository and issues of a particular reposiotry you need to create first **personal access token** by visiting github developer settings
+ For styling purpose I used Chakra UI Library and also write some **css codes** by myself
+ In this application you can check all details of your branches like commit history ,readme and other files and many more.
