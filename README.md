# About 

+ This application created with NextAuth.js and Next.js 
+ Authentication is done with github OAuth 2.0 
+ You need to **generate credentials** first in github developer settings under section named OAuth App
+ I also added authentication with email credentials using MongoDB and NextAuth.js although it is **commented** right now 
+ If you wish to create repository and issues of a particular reposiotry you need to create first **personal access token** by visiting github developer settings
+ For styling purpose I used Chakra UI Library and also write some **custom css codes** by myself
+ In this application you can check all details of your branches like commit history ,readme and other files and many more

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
